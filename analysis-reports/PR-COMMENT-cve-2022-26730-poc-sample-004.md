## Analysis Complete: cve-2022-26730-poc-sample-004.icc

I have completed the comprehensive analysis workflow on `test-profiles/cve-2022-26730-poc-sample-004.icc`.

### Summary

The complete analysis report with **all raw tool output** is available at:
**`analysis-reports/cve-2022-26730-poc-sample-004-analysis.md`**

### Exit Codes

| Command | Exit Code | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| `iccanalyzer-lite -a` (comprehensive) | 1 | Finding detected |
| `iccanalyzer-lite -nf` (ninja full dump) | 0 | Clean (no validation) |
| `iccanalyzer-lite -r` (round-trip test) | 2 | Error (failed to load) |

### ASAN/UBSAN Status

✅ **No memory safety violations detected**
- No AddressSanitizer errors
- No UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer errors
- No crashes or undefined behavior

The only stderr output was benign profiling warnings about missing `.gcda` files from the build environment, which are not security-relevant.

### Key Findings

**✅ Security Heuristics (19 phases)**: All passed
- Valid ICC header and magic bytes
- Proper color space and PCS definitions
- No tag overlaps or suspicious patterns
- Tag sizes and CLUT limits within bounds
- No UAF-prone TagArrayType detected

**❌ Profile Loading**: Failed
- iccDEV parser rejects the profile
- Round-trip validation could not be performed
- Signature analysis skipped

**🔍 Structural Anomalies**:
- Tag aliasing detected: A2B0/A2B2 and B2A0/B2A2 share offsets
- Profile passes header validation but fails deep parsing
- Likely crafted to test CVE-2022-26730 vulnerability

### Conclusion

This profile demonstrates that `iccanalyzer-lite` correctly:
1. ✅ Detects problematic profiles (exit code 1)
2. ✅ Maintains safe failure modes (no crashes)
3. ✅ Provides detailed raw analysis in ninja mode
4. ✅ Prevents memory safety issues through sanitizer instrumentation

The profile is suitable for retention in the test suite as a regression test for CVE-2022-26730 mitigation and parser robustness.
