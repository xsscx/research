# Upstream PR Readiness Audit

Audit `BRANCH_NAME` against `BASE_BRANCH` using
`.github/skills/upstream-pr-readiness/SKILL.md`.

## Inputs

- Repository: `OWNER/REPOSITORY`
- Branch: `BRANCH_NAME`
- Base: `BASE_BRANCH`
- Authorization quotation: `EXACT_USER_QUOTATION` or `NONE`
- Required build/test commands: `COMMANDS`

## Required Behavior

1. Do not create, reopen, edit, or request review on a PR.
2. Fail immediately when explicit authorization is absent.
3. Use a clean worktree and current remote base.
4. Verify rebase, linear history, range-diff, complete diff scope, normal and
   excluded test builds, complete CTest, negative configurations, generated
   artifact cleanup, and suppressed findings.
5. Report only PASS or FAIL with command evidence and blockers.

## Output

base:
